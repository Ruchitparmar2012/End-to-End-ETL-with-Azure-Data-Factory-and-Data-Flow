# End-to-End ETL with Azure Data Factory and Data Flow

Welcome to the End-to-End ETL with Azure Data Factory and Data Flow project! This project showcases a complete Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Flow. 

The pipeline extracts data from two JSON files, converts them to CSV format, and stores them in Azure Blob Storage. It then utilizes Azure Data Flow to perform data transformations, specifically joining employee and department data, and generating aggregated results.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end ETL process using Azure services. It involves the following steps:

 - Data Extraction: 
 
    The pipeline starts by extracting data from two JSON files containing employee and department information. The files are retrieved from a specified location, such as an Azure storage account.

- Data Transformation: 

    The extracted JSON data is transformed using Azure Data Factory pipelines. The pipelines convert the data to CSV format, making it suitable for further processing.

- Data Loading: 

    The transformed CSV data is then loaded into Azure Blob Storage, where it can be easily accessed and analyzed.

- Data Joining: 

    Azure Data Flow is utilized to perform advanced data transformations. In this project, it involves joining the employee and department data based on common fields or keys. This step enables the creation of a unified dataset for analysis.

- Data Aggregation: 
   
    Once the data is joined, Azure Data Flow is used to aggregate the joined dataset. Aggregation operations such as sum, average, count, etc., can be applied to derive meaningful insights and generate summary statistics.

## Project Structure
 
The project repository is organized as follows:

 - pipelines/: 
  
    This directory contains the Azure Data Factory pipeline definitions. It includes pipeline orchestration files, JSON-to-CSV conversion configuration, and file storage connections.

- dataflow/: 
   
    This directory contains the Azure Data Flow definition files. It includes the data joining and aggregation logic implemented using Azure Data Flow transformations.

 - scripts/: 
  
    This directory may contain any necessary scripts used in the project, such as data validation scripts or deployment automation scripts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have an Azure subscription and the necessary permissions to create and manage Azure resources.

- Set up Azure Data Factory and Azure Blob Storage accounts.

- Configure the necessary connections and credentials within Azure Data Factory to access the source JSON files and the target Blob Storage container.

- Import the pipeline definitions from the pipelines/ directory into Azure Data Factory and publish them.

- Import the data flow definition from the dataflow/ directory into Azure Data Factory and deploy it.

- Trigger the pipeline execution to start the ETL process.

- Monitor the pipeline and data flow runs to ensure successful execution.



## Conclusion


This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL process using Azure Data Factory and Data Flow, showcasing the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from JSON files to CSV format. Additionally, it illustrates how to leverage Data Flow for advanced transformations, including data joining and aggregation. 

By following the steps outlined in the project, you can gain hands-on experience with Azure ETL capabilities and adapt them to your specific use cases.
